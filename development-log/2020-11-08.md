Starting with the initial setup of the repository

* Setup up yarn v2
* Adding a `.gitignore` file as suggested [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored)

## Initial misconceptions

When I tried using yarn v2 I did it wrong initially.
I used `yarn set version latest` which will install the latest _currently used_ version.
That resulted in version `1.22.10` being installed.
In order to correctly use version 2 of yarn it's necessary to first install the v2 by using
`yarn set version berry` and **only then**
`yarn set version latest` to update to the latest version (now correctly `2.3.3`)
